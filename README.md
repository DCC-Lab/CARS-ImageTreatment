# CARS-ImageTreatment
## Introduction

The main steps of this code are to : 
- take the input images and correct the horizontal lines produced by the scratched polygon mirror 
- flatten the intensity of the image

More details on the working process of each step are presented next. 

## Step 1 : Line correction 
The raw images acquired with the CARS microscope have dark horizontal lines due to a scratched surface on the polygon mirror. 

## Step 2 : Intensity rescaling
